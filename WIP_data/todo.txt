* Make pktriggercord to compile with -Wextra without errors

* Checkout Makefile depedencies. Edit in pslr_scsi_openbsd and 
  pktriggercord compilation fails.

* Split pktriggercord to -gui, -cli and pslrd.
  - pslrd handles SCSI commands, and is SUID binary
  - --servermode could be starting point.

* Fix all the bugs.
  - better support for K-3 (shutter, aperature and iso aren't always 
    transfered to camera for example) Images are 1/200 but command line 
    wanted 1/180.
