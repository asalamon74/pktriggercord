Known bugs of pkTriggerCord:

  Setting jpeg sharpness/contrast/saturation has no effect sometimes.

  Downloading jpeg with non-maximal resolution does not work.

  Setting exposure mode has no effect ( maybe it's not a bug only it's
  not allowed ).

  Shutter speed table of GUI assumes 1/3 EV steps. This should also 
  work for 1/2 EV steps.

  Changing shutter speed to 1/6000 is not working. It changes to 1/8 
  instead.
