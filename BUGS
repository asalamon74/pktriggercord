Known bugs of pkTriggerCord:

  Program assumes jpeg sharpness/contrast/saturation/hue values to be
  between 0 and 6 (displayed as -3 +3 ). Pentax K-x has values 
  between 0 and 8 (displayed as -4 +4 ). Probably the range is
  camera-specific. 

  Downloading jpeg with non-maximal resolution does not work.

  Setting exposure mode has no effect ( maybe it's not a bug only it's
  not allowed ).
