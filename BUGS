Known bugs of pkTriggerCord:

  Setting jpeg sharpness/contrast/saturation has no effect sometimes.

  Downloading jpeg with non-maximal resolution does not work.

  Setting exposure mode has no effect ( maybe it's not a bug only it's
  not allowed ).

  Changing shutter speed to 1/6000 is not working. It changes to 1/8 
  instead.

  The program does not work as a non-root user on several Linux 
  distributions.

  ISO table of GUI only shows the same iso range for all cameras. It
  should be camera-specific.
