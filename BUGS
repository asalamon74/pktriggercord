Known bugs of pkTriggerCord:

  Sometimes it requires root privileges.

  Setting jpeg sharpness/contrast/saturation has no effect sometimes.

  Taking picture restores jpeg image tone, so jpeg image tone setting
  is quite useless.

  Downloading jpeg with non-maximal resolution does not work.

  Setting exposure mode has no effect ( maybe it's not a bug only it's
  not allowed ).

  K-x: Changing shutter speed to 1/6000 is not working. It changes to 1/8 
  instead.

  K-x: Cannot change ISO in M mode.

  ISO table of GUI only shows the extended iso range even is base iso
  range is set.

  The program stops for approx. 20 minutes after 4-5 hours
  (e.g. --frames 200 --delay 120)

  --select_af_point Auto-11 changes to Auto-5 instead

  Top LCD panel is flashing
